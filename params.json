In a quest to move faster, organizations can end up creating security vulnerabilities using the tools and products meant to protect them. Both Chris Gates (carnal0wnage) and Ken Johnson (cktricky) will share their collaborative research into the technology driving DevOps as well as share their stories of what happens when these tools are used insecurely as well as when the tools are just insecure.   \r\n\r\nTechnologies discussed will encompass AWS Technology, Chef, Puppet, Hudson/Jenkins, Vagrant, Kickstart and much, much more. Everything from common misconfigurations to remote code execution will be presented. This is brand new research to bring awareness to those responsible for securing a DevOps environment.
